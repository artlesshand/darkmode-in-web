# Dark Mode in Web [Pure CSS]
This is a minimal sample to test the dark mode compatibility on web in iOS13 and MacOS Mojave.

As of now, It only works in safari; you can see a [Demo](http://artless.ir/darkmode.html) here.

I'm using `:root` and `prefers-color-scheme:` to specify the darkmode style. If you're not comfortable with the css variables you can also use selectors.
